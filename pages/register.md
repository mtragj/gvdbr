<h2>About the Event</h2>
<p>
The 2025 Grand Valley Dirt Bike Rally will be hosted on October 25th - 27th, 2025 with multiple guided rides on Saturday and Sunday across the Grand Valley. There will be registration check-in on site, vendor booths, food trucks, and activities at our main event site at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eYvQMGQFdTL6SLk26">27 1/4 rd MotoCross Track Event Area</a> through out the event weekend. This event is designed to promote our local trail systems, bring riders from across the region together for a fun weekend of riding, and help grow the local club ( MTRA ) to enable it to continue promoting responsible recreation and partnerships with our local public agencies to maintain and build new trails.
