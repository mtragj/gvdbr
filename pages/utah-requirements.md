All of the Rabbit Valley routes for this year's Grand Valley Dirt Bike Rally will cross into Utah despite staging from Colorado. To be legal to ride in Utah you need a:
* <a href="https://recreation.utah.gov/off-highway-vehicles/ohv-registration-and-permits/non-resident-ohv-permits/">Non-resident OHV Permit</a>
* <a href="https://secured.utah.gov/utoutdoorrecdirectory/Forms/Page/utoutdoorrecdirectory/utohvcourse/1"> An OHV Education Certificate (free online course)<a/>

The non-resident OHV permit is good for 12 months from time of purchase. It can be purchased online for $30, you will get an email receipt and temporary permit that you can use while the permanent one will arrive in the mail 2-3 weeks later. 

<b>Note:</b> If you have a highway legal plated motorcycle, you are <a href="https://recreation.utah.gov/off-highway-vehicles/ohv-registration-and-permits/utah-non-resident-ohv-permits-street-legal-vehicle-faqs/"><b>not required</b></a> to have an OHV permit in Utah while riding their trails.
