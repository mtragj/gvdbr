An opportunity to improve a trail on the North Unc.

Tasks may include:
* Cutting brush away from trail. 
* Clearing any overhanging branches.
* Digging at marsh to drain.

Details will be relayed Saturday by Chris Vestal per USFS.


Two Members will be bringing chain saws. ( Volunteers need to have completed the sawyer certification to operate a saw.) If you are not certified, please do not bring a saw.  All the fallen trees have already been cleared. Chainsaws are just needed for brush clearing this time. 
Hand saws welcome. Loppers (hand shears), even a battery hedge/trimmer will be useful in spots if you have it. We have Trail Boss shovel. Any packable shovels welcome. We will attempt to dig out a couple of streams to drain best we can for the following weekend. 


We will ride motos out from our meeting point on FS 402 (Divide Road)


If you can volunteer, please RSVP to mtrawestco@gmail.com no later than 9am Saturday.  Follow up email  will be sent Saturday afternoon with meet details to those who RSVP.
