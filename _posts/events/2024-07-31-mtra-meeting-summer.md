Just a quick reminder that we are having our next quarterly meeting on the 31st of July, 6pm at the Edgewater Brewery back room. 

The agenda will include updates on our regular rides, elections of club officers, and an exciting new event for this fall.

Please pass this info on to all your trail riding friends and family, and bring them to the meeting - the more the better!
