    what: GVDBR gets dates set with BLM, announces 2026 return of the Rally

---
We have confirmed with the BLM our dates for the Rally in 2026, which will be October 16th-18th this year. Mark your calendars!

We will be following a similar formula to the first one, with a broad variety of guided rides on offer Saturday and Sunday, and a lively Event area for registration, vendors, food trucks, activities and music Friday and Saturday evenings.

We will fine tune our ride offerings based on what riders were looking for to ensure plenty of opportunities for the type of riding folks were looking for in 2025 and add more options at the Event area to ensure everyone enjoys their time off of the bike as well.

Look for Registration to open late spring once the rides have been finalized.
