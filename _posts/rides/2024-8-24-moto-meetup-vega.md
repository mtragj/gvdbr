Head up past Collbran to ride with the MTRA out of Vega State Park.

This ride will start from the Vega State Park OHV staging area (see link at right) and head out on a rocky forest road for a few miles before turning onto some 50 inch ATV trails that will take us up through the aspens. Ride Elevations will vary between ~7k feet and 10,400 feet. Expect a solid 40-60 miles of riding.

While there is no single-track on this ride there will be steep hills, tight switchbacks, and some rocky parts to traverse.

Reminder that all Rides require signing a liability waiver, parents signatures are required for riders under 18. 
Additionally, protective gear is required including helmet, goggles, gloves, and over the ankle boots.
