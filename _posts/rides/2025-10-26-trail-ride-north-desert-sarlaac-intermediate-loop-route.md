"The trail ride will begin along 16 Road (Coal Gulch), at a parking lot
approximately 18 miles north of the highway in Fruita. We will climb the Book
Cliffs and follow the ridge to the northeast allowing some amazing views of the
Grand Valley as well as the mountains to the north. The single track portions can
be best described as moderate speed “flowy” trails with surfaces consisting of
clay, sand, and some rock. A few areas will provide some exposure, but are
relatively safe for anyone will basic bike skills. Total distance will be slightly over
30 miles including the trails and return ride on the gravel road. From beginning to
end, we anticipate being on the bike between 3 and 4 hours depending on the
size of the group, and the speed of the slowest rider. Trails included: Coal Gulch
Road, Sarlacc Trail, Cicada, and Cloud City which can be found on the CoTrex or
OnX Offroad apps for reference."
