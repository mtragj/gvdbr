15 mile loop through the North Fruita Desert.  

Includes a mix of easy two-track and easy single-track, including parts of the Orange Loop and BLM Route 187. 

Although the route is easy, this loop is not intended for true beginners.  Riders signing up for this ride should know how to operate their dirtbike and be fully equipped with riding gear including off-road or MX boots, helmet, gloves, goggles or glasses, and hydration pack.

We’ll have a team of 3 for leading and sweeping and will take plenty of snack breaks and pictures, keeping a pace that is comfortable for the group.
