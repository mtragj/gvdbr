"This loop begins at Bangs Canyon Trailhead with an easy warmup ride to the first 50" trail, Canyon View, which leads up to the start of Rampage Singletrack. This is one of the newest singletracks in the area and includes a couple ramps leading off ledges, some ledge drops and some fast flowing switchbacks. The pace picks up down the Horse Mesa trails with Saddle up 50", Pony Tail singletrack, and Lasso singletrack. Take a breather between Horse Mesa and Windmill Singletrack at the Gunnison River where riders can take a break on the riverbank. Then the long ascent begins up Windmill  Jeep road, and then on to Windmill Singletrack where riders will encounter bench cut singletrack with exposure on multiple occasions, rocky ledges, loose rocks and trees. The trail finishes out through the Tabaguache trail and Bangs Canyon Jeep Road. This route will be rough and exhausting, but also have some great views and fun flowy payoff sections. Enduro bikes with low gearing, electric start and tubliss or mousse tubes is highly recommended."
