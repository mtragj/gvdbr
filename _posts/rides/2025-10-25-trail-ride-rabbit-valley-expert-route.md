This loop is jam packed with action! The start of this route will loop the Trail 8 section which jumps halfway from whoops to ledges but has a fun flow and vibe. The group will loop back past the staging area and make a run for the (Utah) border. The next notable trail, Western Rim, is a much tamer version of Trail 8, but ups the views of the Colorado River throughout the entire stretch. The route continues up a steep loose hill to the upper ridge of the valley. Up here there are lots of rocky whoops, sand, choppy rocks, and lots of brush and trees. To finish off this long stomp of a day, the group will go up Zion Curtaink singletrack which has 2 notable hill climb obstacles, and a large amount of choppy sharp edged rocks. Once clear of the Curtain, there is a nice and relatively smooth ride back to the staging area. This is a good loop for riders who are good with technical moves, body placement, clutch and brake control, ignoring exposure, skipping meals to afford tires, reading the technical manual to your bike before you go to bed.....great for enduro riders.
