31 mile loop on the edge of the Bookcliffs above the North Fruita Desert.

Includes:
* Infamous “Star Wars” trails like Sarlaac, Cicada Ridge, and Cloud City.
* 50/50 mix of scenic two-track and technical intermediate single-track.
* A fair amount of sidehill and exposure. 


We’ll have a team of 3 for leading and sweeping and will take plenty of snack breaks and pictures, keeping a pace that is comfortable for the group.
