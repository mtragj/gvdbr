"Test your skills, wits, and endurance on this 49 mile Extreme desert route. Beginning at the base of the Book Cliffs and riding up a buggy crawling route, you will quickly gain 2,000 feet of elevation. This will be the hardest part of the ride with some challenge-by-choice – you choose how many boulders to conquer! Once at the top of the Book Cliffs, we will transition into advanced singletrack that snakes through what was once the largest wildfire in Colorado. The trail will be mostly sand and dirt with periodic rock features to exercise your throttle, brake, and clutch coordination. This portion of the trail flows well and can be ridden with minimal foot dabs, unlike the earlier 4x4 crawling canyon. There will be uphill and downhill switchbacks, exposed narrow sidehills, some small log hops, and a stretch of narrow winding sidehill that has a few natural opportunities to get airborne. After one last overlook, we’ll quickly drop down and take a relatively easy ride back to staging on high-speed desert floor singletrack. This Extreme route includes most of the North Fruita Desert Advanced route with the crawler canyon added in."
