Join us as we ride flowy desert single-track in the North Fruita Desert nearly all the way to the Utah State Border.

This ride will start out connecting some double-track as we work our way west, eventually dropping into a lengthy flowy section of continuous single-track, riding across ridges and dipping in and out of washes as it heads almost due west and ends up on top of a large ridge with great views a few miles from Utah. 

After a break we'll saddle up and ride it all over again on the way back!
