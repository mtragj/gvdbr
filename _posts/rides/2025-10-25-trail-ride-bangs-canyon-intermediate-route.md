"This 24 mile loop is located in the rocky high desert just south west of Grand Junction off of Little Park Road. The loop begins at the Third Flats Trailhead (the onX Offroad ratings are included for reference). It starts with a three mile single track, Second Thoughts (5/10 intermediate) and one mile ATV trail, Twist and Shout (3/10 easy), and 20 miles of jeep trails - Third Flats/Windmill Loop (4/10 intermediate), Tabeguache (7/10 difficult - although the four mile section needed to complete this loop is closer to a 5-6/10, with options around the more difficult sections) and Billings Canyon Road (3/10 easy).
Some sections are flowing hard pack or mild sand; however, the overall characteristic of this route is rough, rocky and fatiguing. The rocky sections are a mixture of jagged rocks embedded in the hardpack, 6""-14"" ledges and stair steps, and long sections of steep ascents/descents with a combination of large embedded rocks and loose softball sized rocks.
Riders for this trail should possess strong intermediate skills and reasonable riding endurance/fitness. Bikes should be well maintained dirt bikes/dual sports with aggressive tires and good suspension.
There will be two or three scheduled rest stops to take in the scenic views and have a snack. The time on trail will be approximately 4 hours."
