15 mile loop through the North Fruita Desert.  

This route is very friendly to those who need to start venturing a little further away from the truck, or those who are starting to ride singletrack. The trail consist of some linear singletrack that has very minimal elevation changes, minimal amount of whoops, minimal amounts of rocks, but maximum amounts of dirt. All riders are expected to show up with their own dirt bike in working condition, with basic riding skills such as starting the bike, clutch, brake, throttle, and shifter use.
