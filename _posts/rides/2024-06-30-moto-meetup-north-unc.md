Getting hot down in the Valley, come ride the MTRA up on the Uncompaghre Plateau or "The Unc!"

This ride will start from the Divide Forks Staging area (see link at right) and head out on some 50 inch ATV trails before dipping into some intermediate single-track through the aspens. Expect a solid 40-60 miles of riding.

Reminder that all Rides require signing a liability waiver, parents signatures required for riders under 18.
