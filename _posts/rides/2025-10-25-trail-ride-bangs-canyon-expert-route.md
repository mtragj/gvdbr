"This is a very challenging route that starts at Third Flats trailhead and begins on the warmup trail of Second Thoughts. Once riders are warmed up and ready, the trail continues on Butterknife singletrack which includes choppy, ledgy, and rocky terrain. The group gets a break while riding through Art Crooks view to rollover ridge up to where Rampage singletrack begins. Rampage is one of the newest singletracks in the area which includes some fun ledges, fast turning switchbacks, and more rocky drop offs. The trail meets up with a jeep road where there is a very short ride over to the Horse Mesa trails of 50" trail Saddle Up, singletrack Pony Tail, and finally Lasso. These trails are all less difficult, but fast and flowy. The route continues to the riverbanks of the Gunnison River where a well earned break will occur. To finish off the day the gorup will ascend up Windmill road to the Windmill singletrack that has it's own challenges of choppy rocks, ledges, switchbacks, off camber side hills, and great views. At the top, the group will ride out through the Tabaguache trail into Bangs Canyon Jeep trail where there are plenty of fun optional obstacles if riders still have energy to burn. Overall, this will be a long and technical endurance ride where clutch, brake, and throttle control is absolutalely nessecary. Enduro bikes with low gearing, electric start and tubliss or mousse tubes is highly recommended."
