This loop will be a fast paced trail ride through some challenging sharp edged rocky terrain including ledges, rocky sand whoops, hill descents, technical moves. The route will begin by crossing the interstate headed North into the desert. The groups first singletrack  technical singletrack will begin on Zion Curtain which is a fast flowy ride through the cedar trees which includes loose rocky sharp edged rocks, ledge drops, and hill descents. The trail continues on the Overlook Loop which has lots of sandy rocky whoops which will keep riders on their toes. There will be a short ride down a full width road descending into lower Rabbit Valley up to the Adobe Singletrack. Riders should be prepared for some ankle hieght rocks that may pull their feet off the pegs, and a few more ledge drops. Western Rim trail is next on the list which will be a fun, fast paced singletrack that skirts the upper rim of the Colorado River canyon giving off great views the entire length. To finish off the day the last trail will be Trail #2 which starts singletrack and ends as doubletrack, but is fast paced terrain with fun obstacles along the way. Riders should have good bike control and bike setup for running through sharp edge choppy terrain. This will be a great adventure that will challenge any rider.
