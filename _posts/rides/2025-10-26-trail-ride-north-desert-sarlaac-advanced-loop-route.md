"47 mile Advanced skill level Sarlac/North Desert loop. Ride begins at 5,300 ft elevation, climbing up to 7,400 ft elevation. Lots of open edge vertical exposure; if you deal with vertigo, this is not the ride for you. 

85% single track, 15% open desert/gravel wash bed. 8-10 moderate rock-step features/obstacles throughout, uphill and downhill; the last one being a challenging downhill rock-step feature estimated at 35-45 feet long. Minimal shade coverage; pack lots of water and snacks. Estimated time: 4.5-5.5 hours (pending numbers of riders, speed travel, rest stops)."
